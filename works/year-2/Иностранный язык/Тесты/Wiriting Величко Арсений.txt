Hi, user.

It depends on several factors. First of all, if you are going to be the only user of that machine I recommend you buy a multifunction printer, since it doesn't take as much space as two separate units would. An MFU is generally easier to use and is generally more convenient, than two standalone devices, in my opinion.

However, there are several downsides to it. One of them is the cost. MFUs are usually more expensive than regular printers. They're also more complex and tend to break down more often, while being more expensive to repair. If your MFU breaks down - you will lose both your printer and scanner.

The other disadvantage is that you cannot use MFUs to print and scan documents simultaneously. So, if you want to share the device with other people, I would recommend buying a printer and a scanner separately.

Still, besides all the disadvantages, I own a multifunction unit and like it. I hope this will help you make a decision.
